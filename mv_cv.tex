\section{summary}
\begin{content}
  {
Lead engineer specializing in DevOps, cloud-first architecture, and automation.

I'm passionate about technology, like solving difficult problems, and never pass up an opportunity to expand my skillset.

Experience building solutions in some of the largest CDN, Cloud, and E-Commerce platforms in the world.

I believe an effective DevOps culture empowers fast, fearless releases and embraces modern solutions.

I like to build testable, robust infrastructure(as code) for every team in the stack.

I think simple automation can be a big win, and complexity isn't always correct.

I'm also a blogger and freelance technical content creator.
