# Mike Vanbuskirk's Resume

Inspired by great examples and templates from places like [http://LaTeXTemplates.com](http://latextemplates.com) and [https://github.com/deedydas/Deedy-Resume](https://github.com/deedydas/Deedy-Resume), I decided to take the plunge and convert my resume from Microsoft Word format to LaTeX.

LaTeX provides several advantages over standard word-processing platforms, including standardized and widely accepted formatting, robust templates, and easy integration with Version Control Systems.

This document will be a work in progress, and I will update it as needed with relevant experience, projects, and aesthetic modifications.

This is based off the Wilson Resume/CV template from [http://LaTeXTemplates.com](http://latextemplates.com). Original author is [Howard Wilson](https://github.com/watsonbox/cv_template_2004) with extensive modifications by [Vel](vel@latextemplates.com).
